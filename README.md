# NectarineGameEngine
NGE is highly inspired by the simple but addictive and fun gameplay of Nectaris GB, a game for the GameBoy. 
The goal of the NGE is to facilitate the creation of Nectaris-like games by providing a template upon which one can make their own kind of game.

Note: this isn't faithful to any of the Nectaris games on purpose to avoid all legal trouble.
